# CareerFoundry - Technical Task

## Solution to the tech assignment created with pure javascript, html and css. 

### For running the application locally I used LiveServer extension in VSCode.

## Notes and possible improvements
* Overall I would spend more time to optimize the styles, avoid repetitive code and work more on dynamic way of handling fetched data (specifically in displaySingleCourse.js component)
* I would also like to bundle the application with webpack

Thank you for your attention!
